# API reference (Phase 1 + Phase 2)

Base URL defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The interactive OpenAPI UI at
`/docs` is generated automatically by FastAPI from the route signatures and
Pydantic models; it lists the endpoints and parameters, but several routes
return plain objects without a declared `response_model`, so their response
schemas show as generic. This file summarizes the intended contract and payload
shapes.

All error responses use the spec §13 envelope:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "ANALYSIS_NOT_FOUND", "message": "...", "details": {} } }
```

## POST /analyses  (spec §12.1)

**Parse** an architecture YAML into a stored graph. This is the first of two
stages: it builds and persists the IR/graph but does **not** run the rule engine
yet, so no findings are produced here (the wizard shows the inferred
capabilities for editing, then calls `POST .../analyze`). The finding counts in
`summary` are therefore all zero and `status` is `"parsed"`.

- Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`
- Fields:
  - `file` (required) — the architecture YAML.
  - `framework` (optional) — adapter override (`generic`, `crewai`, `dify`,
    `langgraph`); omitted, the framework is auto-detected.
  - `name` (optional) — analysis name; overrides the YAML's `metadata.name`
    when provided. Echoed back as `name` in the response.

Response:

```json
{
  "analysis_id": "uuid",
  "status": "parsed",
  "name": "HireSmart Copilot",
  "summary": { "nodes": 7, "edges": 6, "findings": 0,
               "critical": 0, "high": 0, "medium": 0, "max_score": 0.0 }
}
```

Common errors: `EMPTY_INPUT`, `INVALID_YAML`, `INVALID_NODE_TYPE`,
`UNKNOWN_CAPABILITY`, `INVALID_IR` (400).

## POST /analyses/{analysis_id}/analyze

**Analyze** stage: run the rule engine over the stored graph and overwrite the
analysis with the findings. Call this after `POST /analyses`, optionally with the
user's edited capabilities.

- Content-Type: `application/json` (optional body).
- Body:
  - **omitted / empty** — analyze the stored parsed graph as-is (the first run,
    when the user made no edits).
  - `{ "nodes": [...], "edges": [...] }` — the user's edited graph (the full
    graph, not a diff). Node shape: `{ id, type, name, properties }` (`type` is a
    backend `NodeType`, e.g. `data_asset`). Edge shape:
    `{ id, source, target, capability, properties }`. The pipeline reconciles by
    id against the stored IR: an existing id keeps its stored (authoritative)
    `properties` and only takes the edited `name`/`capability`; a newly added
    node/edge is created fresh and picks up the normalizer's conservative
    defaults (input→untrusted, output→external, data_asset→medium sensitivity).

Response (same shape as `/analyze` produces for the results view):

```json
{
  "analysis_id": "uuid",
  "status": "completed",
  "name": "HireSmart Copilot",
  "summary": { "nodes": 7, "edges": 6, "findings": 3,
               "critical": 1, "high": 2, "medium": 0, "max_score": 10.0 },
  "graph": { "nodes": [], "edges": [] },
  "findings": [ { "id", "rule_id", ... } ]
}
```

The stored analysis is overwritten under the same id, so subsequent
`GET .../graph`, `GET .../findings` and the control endpoints reflect the
analyzed (and, if edited, corrected) graph. Errors: `ANALYSIS_NOT_FOUND` (404);
`INVALID_IR`, `UNKNOWN_CAPABILITY`, `INVALID_NODE_TYPE` (400) for a malformed
edited graph.

## GET /analyses/{analysis_id}/graph  (spec §12.2)

Returns the normalized graph in the frontend shape:

```json
{
  "nodes": [{ "id", "label", "type", "risk_score", "properties", "badges": [] }],
  "edges": [{ "id", "source", "target", "label", "capability", "properties",
              "risk_level", "blocked": false, "mitigated": false,
              "finding_ids": [] }]
}
```

`404 ANALYSIS_NOT_FOUND` if the id is unknown. `blocked`/`mitigated` are always
false here; they are set by the control simulator (§12.6).

## GET /analyses/{analysis_id}/findings  (spec §12.3)

Returns findings ordered by `score` descending:

```json
{ "findings": [ { "id", "rule_id", "title", "severity", "score", "category",
                  "finding_class", "path": [], "edges": [], "derivation",
                  "evidence": {}, "recommended_controls": [], "owasp_agentic": [],
                  "owasp_llm": [], "mitre_atlas": [] } ] }
```

`finding_class` is a derived label, not a stored field: `"attack"` for an
exploitable capability path, or `"hygiene"` for a hygiene/compliance signal (the
rule ids in `HYGIENE_RULE_IDS`, the single source of truth in
`core/rules/common.py`). It carries no scoring weight — it exists so the client
can present attack paths and hygiene findings as separate channels rather than
one ranked list. The same field appears on every finding returned by `/analyze`
and `/findings/{finding_id}`.

## GET /analyses/{analysis_id}/findings/{finding_id}  (spec §12.4)

Returns one finding plus a `path_graph` subgraph limited to that finding's nodes
and edges (same node/edge shape as `/graph`):

```json
{ "finding": { ... }, "path_graph": { "nodes": [], "edges": [] } }
```

`404 FINDING_NOT_FOUND` if the finding id is unknown.

## GET /analyses/{analysis_id}/controls/recommendations  (spec §12.5)

Recommends controls for the analysis, ranked by estimated risk reduction
(descending), then by demo priority. Each recommendation is measured by a
single-control what-if simulation, so `breaks_findings` and
`estimated_risk_reduction` are computed, not guessed.

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "control_id": "humanInTheLoop",
      "name": "Human approval",
      "target_node_id": "output_email_candidate",
      "breaks_findings": ["finding_001"],
      "estimated_risk_reduction": 10.0,
      "cost_estimate": "low",
      "demo_priority": "must_show"
    }
  ]
}
```

`404 ANALYSIS_NOT_FOUND` if the id is unknown.

## POST /analyses/{analysis_id}/simulate-controls  (spec §12.6, §11.1)

Simulates applying a caller-supplied set of controls and returns before/after
risk. Body:

```json
{ "controls_to_apply": [
    { "control_id": "humanInTheLoop", "target_node_id": "output_email_candidate" }
] }
```

A control applied to a node marks every edge incident to that node whose
capability it breaks. `effect: total` marks the edge `blocked` and cuts it from
the recomputed graph (the attack path disappears); `effect: partial` marks it
`mitigated` and instead lowers the score of any surviving finding that crosses
it. The stored analysis is never mutated. Response:

```json
{
  "analysis_id": "uuid",
  "applied_controls": [
    { "control_id", "name", "category", "effect", "target_node_id",
      "affected_edge_ids": [] }
  ],
  "before": { "finding_count": 3, "critical_count": 1, "max_score": 10.0 },
  "after":  { "finding_count": 2, "critical_count": 0, "max_score": 8.8 },
  "risk_reduction": { "absolute": 10.0, "percentage": 36.2 },
  "broken_paths": [
    { "finding_id": "finding_001", "rule_id": "FH-001",
      "broken_by": "humanInTheLoop", "target_node_id": "output_email_candidate" }
  ],
  "graph": { "nodes": [], "edges": [] }
}
```

The returned `graph` includes the applied controls as `type: control` nodes and
flags the affected edges `blocked`/`mitigated`. Errors: `UNKNOWN_CONTROL`,
`UNKNOWN_TARGET_NODE` (400); `ANALYSIS_NOT_FOUND` (404).
