# AgentHound

AgentHound analyzes multi-agent architecture definitions (CrewAI, Dify, LangGraph, generic YAML) for capability paths that lead to risk, following a BloodHound-style model: typed capability edges between nodes, risk evaluated on the combination of capabilities, node properties, and missing controls.

"Generic YAML" is not a third-party framework but AgentHound's own explicit `nodes`/`edges` format: a thin authoring layer over the internal model that the framework adapters also target, and the most expressive of the four (it can describe full capability paths the tree-shaped adapter outputs cannot). It is auto-detected from top-level `nodes` and `edges`.

## Repository layout

- [`Backend/`](Backend/) — FastAPI backend service (Pydantic v2 + NetworkX). See [`Backend/app/docs/README.md`](Backend/app/docs/README.md) for backend-only details.
- [`Frontend/`](Frontend/) — Next.js + Mistica web app. The threat-model wizard uploads an architecture YAML, calls the backend, and renders the capability graph, findings, and risk metrics. See [`Frontend/README.md`](Frontend/README.md).
- [`examples/`](examples/) — Engine-verified example architectures (four progressive scenarios as CrewAI, Dify, LangGraph, and generic YAML, plus a risky/safe pair migrated from an earlier proof of concept) with per-scenario notes, usable as a demo set and regression bank. See [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md).

## Status

The backend is implemented: generic YAML parser, normalized IR, NetworkX graph, the v0.2 rule catalog (35 rules across path, node and edge patterns) with each finding classified as an attack path or a hygiene/compliance signal, numeric scoring, and the read API. Analysis is two-stage: `POST /analyses` parses the YAML into a stored graph, then `POST .../analyze` runs the rule engine (`GET .../graph`, `GET .../findings` read the result).

The **frontend is linked to the backend**: the wizard performs a real analysis end-to-end (upload → parse → review/correct capabilities in the **Inference** step → analyze → rendered results). The Inference step's capability edits feed the analyzed graph, so the findings, scores, and counts follow the user's corrections. **Phase 2 (control recommendation + simulation)** is implemented on both sides — the backend serves `GET .../controls/recommendations` and `POST .../simulate-controls`, and the UI's "Proposed Solution" tab renders the live before/after metrics, remediation timeline, and mitigated graph. **Phase 3** adapters (CrewAI, Dify, LangGraph) are implemented; generic-format YAML is also processed (see [Try it](#try-it)).

## Running locally

The app is two processes: the **backend** API on port `8000` and the **frontend** dev server on port `3000`. Start the backend first, then the frontend. The backend allows any `localhost` origin by default, so no extra configuration is needed for local development.

For local development the recommended backend runtime is a **Python virtual environment** (it pairs naturally with the `pnpm` frontend over `localhost`). A **Docker** image is also provided for a self-contained backend run; see [Backend option B](#backend-option-b-docker).

### Backend (option A: venv — recommended)

Requires Python 3.11+.

```bash
# from Backend/
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate            # Linux/macOS
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1    # Windows (PowerShell)
pip install -e ".[dev]"
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API is now at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (Swagger UI at `/docs`, health at `/health`).

### Backend (option B: Docker)

```bash
# from Backend/
docker build -t agenthound-backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v "$PWD/data:/data" agenthound-backend
```

### Frontend

Requires Node.js 20+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (the repo pins `pnpm@11`).

```bash
# from Frontend/
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and go to **New model** to run the wizard.

The frontend targets `http://localhost:8000` by default. To point it at a
different backend, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENTHOUND_API_URL` (e.g. in
`Frontend/.env.local`):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENTHOUND_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Backend environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `AGENTHOUND_CORS_ORIGINS` | any `localhost` origin | Comma-separated exact origins to allow (set for a non-localhost frontend). |
| `AGENTHOUND_DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Where analyses are persisted as JSON. |
| `AGENTHOUND_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` | `2097152` (2 MiB) | Maximum accepted upload size. |

## Testing

Backend (pytest):

```bash
# from Backend/ (venv active)
pytest
```

Frontend (type-check, lint, and unit tests):

```bash
# from Frontend/
pnpm test:ts
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

## Try it

The end-to-end path works today with **generic-format YAML** (top-level `nodes`/`edges`; the backend auto-detects the `generic` framework). A ready fixture ships in the repo:

```bash
# from Backend/ (backend running on :8000)
# 1. Parse the YAML into a stored graph (no rules run yet: findings are 0).
curl -F "file=@tests/fixtures/hiresmart_generic.yaml" http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyses
# -> {"analysis_id": "...", "status": "parsed", "summary": {...}}
# 2. Run the analysis (empty body = analyze the parsed graph as-is; send a
#    {nodes, edges} body to analyze an edited graph). This produces the findings.
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyses/<analysis_id>/analyze
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyses/<analysis_id>/graph
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyses/<analysis_id>/findings
```

In the UI, upload the same fixture and select the **n8n** framework (which routes to backend auto-detection for this generic-format file). CrewAI, Dify, and LangGraph are supported by the Phase 3 adapters. The CrewAI config step accepts its native two files (`agents.yaml` + `tasks.yaml`); the wizard merges them into the single `agents:`/`tasks:` document the backend ingests.
